# Manual Migration Rollback Guide

## Overview

The Multicluster Global Hub migration process consists of the following phases:
- **Pending** → **Validating** → **Initializing** → **Deploying** → **Registering** → **Cleaning** → **Completed**

### When Manual Rollback is Needed

- **Validating**: Migration hasn't started. No rollback needed - correct the CR and recreate.
- **Initializing/Deploying/Registering**: Automatic rollback is triggered on failure. If automatic rollback fails due to network issues or unexpected failures, manual intervention is required.
- **Cleaning**: Migration is essentially complete. Only manual cleanup of residual resources may be needed.

---

## Rollback Procedures by Phase

### 1. Initializing Phase Rollback

**Failure Scenario**: Network connectivity issues, ManagedServiceAccount creation failure, or bootstrap secret/KlusterletConfig configuration failure.

#### 1.1 Multicluster Global Hub Environment

Delete the ManagedServiceAccount created for the migration:

```bash
kubectl delete managedserviceaccount <migration-name> -n <target-hub-name>
```

#### 1.2 Source Hub

**Step 1: Remove migration annotations** from each affected ManagedCluster

Annotations to remove:
- `global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/migrating`
- `agent.open-cluster-management.io/klusterlet-config`

```bash
kubectl annotate managedcluster <cluster-name> \
  global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/migrating- \
  agent.open-cluster-management.io/klusterlet-config-
```

<details>
<summary>Batch processing script</summary>

```bash
for CLUSTER in cluster1 cluster2 cluster3; do
  kubectl annotate managedcluster ${CLUSTER} \
    global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/migrating- \
    agent.open-cluster-management.io/klusterlet-config-
done
```
</details>

**Step 2: Delete the bootstrap secret** used for cluster registration

- Name format: `bootstrap-<target-hub-name>`
- Namespace: `multicluster-engine`

```bash
kubectl delete secret bootstrap-<target-hub-name> -n multicluster-engine
```

**Step 3: Delete the KlusterletConfig** created for migration

- Name format: `migration-<target-hub-name>`

```bash
kubectl delete klusterletconfig migration-<target-hub-name>
```

#### 1.3 Target Hub

**Step 1: Remove the auto-approve user** from ClusterManager's AutoApproveUsers list

- User format: `system:serviceaccount:<target-hub-name>:<migration-name>`

```bash
kubectl edit clustermanager cluster-manager
# Remove the line containing the MSA user from spec.registrationConfiguration.autoApproveUsers
```

**Step 2: Delete migration RBAC resources**

| Resource Type | Name Format |
|---------------|-------------|
| ClusterRole (SubjectAccessReview) | `global-hub-migration-<migration-name>-sar` |
| ClusterRoleBinding (SubjectAccessReview) | `global-hub-migration-<migration-name>-sar` |
| ClusterRoleBinding (Registration) | `global-hub-migration-<migration-name>-registration` |

```bash
kubectl delete clusterrole global-hub-migration-<migration-name>-sar
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding global-hub-migration-<migration-name>-sar
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding global-hub-migration-<migration-name>-registration
```

---

### 2. Deploying Phase Rollback

**Failure Scenario**: Kafka broker network issues, resource application failure on target hub, or deployment confirmation timeout.

#### 2.1 Multicluster Global Hub Environment

Same as [Initializing Phase - Global Hub](#11-global-hub)

#### 2.2 Source Hub

Perform all steps from [Initializing Phase - Source Hub](#12-source-hub):

- Step 1: Remove migration annotations from ManagedClusters
- Step 2: Delete bootstrap secret
- Step 3: Delete KlusterletConfig

#### 2.3 Target Hub

**Step 1: Delete deployed ManagedClusters** that were created during migration

```bash
kubectl delete managedcluster <cluster-name>
```

**Step 2: Delete KlusterletAddonConfigs**

- Name: `<cluster-name>`
- Namespace: `<cluster-name>`

```bash
kubectl delete klusterletaddonconfig <cluster-name> -n <cluster-name>
```

<details>
<summary>Batch processing script</summary>

```bash
CLUSTERS=("cluster1" "cluster2" "cluster3")

for CLUSTER in "${CLUSTERS[@]}"; do
  kubectl delete managedcluster ${CLUSTER}
  kubectl delete klusterletaddonconfig ${CLUSTER} -n ${CLUSTER}
done
```
</details>

**Step 3: Delete RBAC resources** same as [Initializing Phase - Target Hub](#13-target-hub)

---

### 3. Registering Phase Rollback

**Failure Scenario**: Network issues preventing cluster re-registration, cluster connection failures to target hub, or ManifestWork application timeout.

> **Important**: Some clusters may have successfully registered to the target hub while others failed. The migration controller tracks cluster migration status in a ConfigMap. You need to get the list of failed clusters for rollback:
>
> ```bash
> # ConfigMap name: <migration-name> (same as ManagedClusterMigration CR name)
> # Default Namespace: multicluster-global-hub
> # Key: "failure" - contains comma-separated list of failed cluster names
> kubectl get configmap <migration-name> -n <multicluster-global-hub-namespace> -o jsonpath='{.data.failure}'
> ```

#### 3.1 Multicluster Global Hub Environment

Same as [Initializing Phase - Global Hub](#11-global-hub)

#### 3.2 Source Hub

**Step 1: Set HubAcceptsClient to true** for each failed cluster to restore connectivity to source hub

Single cluster:
```bash
kubectl patch managedcluster <cluster-name> --type=json \
  -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/hubAcceptsClient", "value": true}]'
```

<details>
<summary>Batch processing script using ConfigMap</summary>

```bash
# Step 1: Get failed clusters list from Global Hub (run this on Global Hub kubeconfig)
# The ConfigMap only exists on Global Hub
FAILED_CLUSTERS=$(kubectl get configmap <migration-name> -n multicluster-global-hub -o jsonpath='{.data.failure}' --kubeconfig=<global-hub-kubeconfig>)

# Step 2: Run on Source Hub to restore connectivity (switch to Source Hub kubeconfig)
# Convert comma-separated list to array
IFS=',' read -ra CLUSTERS <<< "$FAILED_CLUSTERS"

# Restore HubAcceptsClient for each failed cluster
for CLUSTER in "${CLUSTERS[@]}"; do
  echo "Restoring connectivity for cluster: $CLUSTER"
  kubectl patch managedcluster ${CLUSTER} --type=json \
    -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/hubAcceptsClient", "value": true}]' \
    --kubeconfig=<source-hub-kubeconfig>
done
```
</details>

**Step 2: Perform all Initializing rollback steps**

Refer to [Initializing Phase - Source Hub](#12-source-hub):

- Step 1: Remove migration annotations (for failed clusters only)
- Step 2: Delete bootstrap secret
- Step 3: Delete KlusterletConfig

#### 3.3 Target Hub

Same as [Deploying Phase - Target Hub](#23-target-hub):

- Step 1: Delete ManagedClusters
- Step 2: Delete KlusterletAddonConfigs
- Step 3: Delete RBAC resources

---

### 4. Cleaning Phase Manual Cleanup

**Scenario**: Migration completed successfully, but the cleaning phase failed to remove residual resources.

> **Note**: The cleaning phase removes resources from the source hub for clusters that successfully migrated to the target hub. You need to get the list of successfully migrated clusters from the ConfigMap:
>
> ```bash
> # ConfigMap name: <migration-name> (same as ManagedClusterMigration CR name)
> # Default Namespace: multicluster-global-hub
> # Key: "success" - contains comma-separated list of successfully migrated cluster names
> kubectl get configmap <migration-name> -n multicluster-global-hub -o jsonpath='{.data.success}'
> ```

#### 4.1 Multicluster Global Hub Environment

Delete the ManagedServiceAccount:

```bash
kubectl delete managedserviceaccount <migration-name> -n <target-hub-name>
```

#### 4.2 Source Hub

**Step 1: Delete bootstrap secret and KlusterletConfig**

```bash
kubectl delete secret bootstrap-<target-hub-name> -n multicluster-engine
kubectl delete klusterletconfig migration-<target-hub-name>
```

**Step 2: Delete migrated ManagedClusters** where `spec.hubAcceptsClient=false`

Single cluster:
```bash
kubectl delete managedcluster <cluster-name>
```

<details>
<summary>Batch processing script using ConfigMap</summary>

```bash
# Step 1: Get successfully migrated clusters list from Global Hub (run this on Global Hub kubeconfig)
# The ConfigMap only exists on Global Hub
SUCCESS_CLUSTERS=$(kubectl get configmap <migration-name> -n <multicluster-global-hub-namespace> -o jsonpath='{.data.success}' --kubeconfig=<global-hub-kubeconfig>)

# Step 2: Run on Source Hub to delete migrated clusters (switch to Source Hub kubeconfig)
# Convert comma-separated list to array
IFS=',' read -ra CLUSTERS <<< "$SUCCESS_CLUSTERS"

# Delete each successfully migrated cluster from source hub
for CLUSTER in "${CLUSTERS[@]}"; do
  echo "Deleting migrated cluster: $CLUSTER"
  kubectl delete managedcluster ${CLUSTER} --kubeconfig=<source-hub-kubeconfig>
done
```
</details>

> **Note**: These clusters have already migrated to the target hub and should be removed from the source hub.

#### 4.3 Target Hub

Delete migration RBAC resources same as [Initializing Phase - Target Hub](#13-target-hub)
